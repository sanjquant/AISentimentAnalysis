Contributing pretax income to your 401k does reduce your “adjusted gross income”. So I can see why you would wonder about it. But it seems like my state uses gross wages to calculate unemployment benefits, so 401k contributions wouldn’t matter. You should google it for your state though and if it’s based on gross income then you’re fine.\\nI like how OP asks a reasonable question that actually makes sense and every single comment but 1 is making fun of him. You're all idiots.\\nMake sure your company match is based on percentage of whole year versus percentage of each check. I.e. company match up to 7% is per pay period. If you contribute 0 the first 6 months, contributing 14% the last 6 months may only get you the 7% match for the last 6 months.\\n\",\n",

Internally, most accumulated ETFs work by periodically reinvesting the dividends into the fund itself by buying more stocks. So basically you get the exact same effect as if you were reinvesting them yourself, except you don’t need to pay income taxes before reinvesting. So you’re basically automating the entire process.\\n\\nIMO buying the distributed version of that ETF is pointless. If you care about income(which you shouldn’t overly care about it unless you’re close to retirement or are very short term risk averse) you have way better dividend focused ETFs which have less growth, but much better dividend yield and yield growth.\\n\\nIf you’re American, take a look at SCHD or JEPI. If you’re European, take a look at FUSD, SPYD or VHYD(FUSD is my favourite as it has better dividend growth, while SPYD has better upfront yield and VHYD has better diversification).\\n\\nI’m not particular short term risk averse, but I do invest a small percentage in those ETFs to keep my portfolio stable.\\nTry on /r/eupersonalfinance\\nAre you absolutely sure you are looking at two ETFs denominated in the same currency?\\n\\n[Please read this article for more info](https://irishfinancial.ie/vusa-vs-vuaa-vs-vuag-vs-vusd-sp-500-etfs-differences-explained/?utm_content=cmp-true).\\n',\n",

      "Now some intangibles that could give up some unexpected and perhaps undeserved upside.  One is that falling from 300+ to $59 may mean it's been significantly derisked.  Another is that the market should reward them when the current failed CEO gets replaced.  \n",

You should google it for your state though and if it’s based on gross income then you’re fine.\n",
